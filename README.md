# <a name="Introduction"></a>  Introduction
This project focuses on implementation of unsupervised Machine Learning methods for outlier detection to avoid mistakes when manually labeling data 
using deeplabcut GUI before the training process.

The main idea is to obtain the geometric features of labels on images, cluster labels using unsupervised Machine Learning methods, and identify images with bad labels.

You can see the general pipeline below:
1. Data visualization.
2. Computing features: 
      - the distance between every two body parts;
      - angle and angle sign between three points
	  (e. g. left ear, snout, right ear).
3. PCA.
4. Clustering.
